- salient point
 - the test to do:
	3 phases
	- P1 - [Sync only]: FULL sync, progress sync-1way (p6 to steps only), progress-2way, manual (3 test: Group folder, TANO, Func Loc)
		- FULL:
			- UDF Sync
			- Resources Sync
			- Project Sync (EPS, Project, activity codes, activity values)
			- WBS Sync (WBS Code, WBS value, task created, auto-relationship)
			- Resource sync
			- UDF values
			- Progress sync
				- 1-way
				- 2-way
			
	- P2 - UI test only without any sync
	- P3 - P1 + P2 full test including UI



UAT - only on P1 and P2. P3 not needed

Issue
- Datetime resolved

SCAFFOLDER – CSE -change to short "-"

BINA
- some DUR-HRS (after synced to Primavera) not appeared if there is any row Null (in DUR-HRS)
	- root cause = during the sync, the sync program mistakenly cast Int instead Decimal
- At Primavera Start/Finish, there is "A"even though there is no activity started/finished
- PlanFinish somehow being written as 1/1/1901 from IM
